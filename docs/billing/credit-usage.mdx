## How Credit Consumption Works

### 1. Priority: Plan Credits First

Your monthly plan credits are used first.

### 2. Add-On Credits Next

If your base credits run out, Bacon automatically starts using your purchased credit packs, which are valid for 90 days. The specific details of pricing are discussed in the next section of this guide

### 5. Resolution Determines Credits

For images:

- Basic → 3 credits
- High → 5 credits

For videos:

- Higher quality models (Veo3 & Veo3.1) cost more credits than Video basic and Video high.

## Purchasing Add-on Credits

If you ever need more credits mid-cycle, you can buy Add-On Credit Packs directly inside Bacon.

**How it works:**

- Add-on credits come in bundles of 500 credits.
- Each 500-credit bundle costs \$100.
- The slider in the 'Usage' page in your profile lets you choose how many bundles you want - it moves only in increments of 500.
- Once you confirm the quantity, you're redirected to a secure Stripe checkout to complete the purchase.

These add-on credits are separate from your monthly plan credits and remain valid for 90 days from the day of purchase.

### Add-On Credit Pricing Examples

| Credits Purchased | Price | Notes                 |
| ----------------- | ----- | --------------------- |
| 500 credits       | \$100 | Minimum add-on bundle |
| 1,000 credits     | \$200 | 2 bundles of 500      |
| 1,500 credits     | \$300 | 3 bundles of 500      |
| 2,000 credits     | \$400 | 4 bundles of 500      |

## Examples of How Bacon Calculates Usage

Please note - These are APPROXIMATE values.

**Example 1: You generate 10 High Images**

10 images × 5 credits = 50 credits

**Example 2: You generate 2 Veo3 videos**

2 × 50 credits = 100 credits

**Example 3: You generate 1 Product Avatar**

1 × 30 credits = 30 credits
