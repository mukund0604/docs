# Understanding Your Brand Profile (Brand DNA)

Your Brand Profile is the core of how Bacon understands, interprets, and recreates your brand identity. Everything Bacon generates — is based on the Brand DNA!

## What the Brand Profile Includes

- **Business Details**: Your brand name and URL help Bacon scan your online presence and learn your visual language automatically.
- **Logos**: Adding your logo(s) allows Bacon to place them with correct spacing, visibility, and brand rules.
- **Typography**: Your headline, subhead, and body fonts help Bacon maintain consistent hierarchy and style across every creative.
- **Color Palette**: From primary colors to accents, Bacon applies your palette intelligently across backgrounds, elements, and layouts.
- **Visual & Layout Standards**: This includes your design style, photography feel, spacing rules, framing preferences, and brand-specific do's and don'ts.
- **Brand Voice**: Tone, personality, keywords, phrases, and messaging rules help Bacon write copy that sounds unmistakably "you."

## Why It Matters

The stronger your Brand Profile, the more accurate and consistent your generated content becomes. Bacon uses these inputs to ensure everything — from ad creatives to videos — looks brand-perfect from the moment it's created.
