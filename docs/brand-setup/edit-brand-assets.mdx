# How to Edit Products, Logos, Colors & Brand Assets

Apart from what Bacon collects itself, you are always able to go back and edit the details of your Brand DNA at any time - so your designs can grow with you! Remember, Bacon will perform best when it has all your creative ingredients.

This article helps you learn how to edit your brand assets quickly and correctly.

## Adding Your Logo

You can upload primary and alternate logos if you have them (light mode, dark mode, monochrome).

Bacon uses these versions automatically depending on the creative background and contrast requirement.

## Setting Your Typography

Bacon pre-selects some font styles, but you can always remove/ add more options. We use these fonts for:

- Headlines
- Subheadings
- Body text

## Adding Your Color Palette

Apart from the pre-selected color palette, you can also:

- Enter HEX codes
- Pick new colors manually with a dropper

## Define Your Brand Voice Clearly

You can edit the details of the brand voice we collect. Be specific about:

- Tone (e.g., bold, joyful, premium, minimal)
- Personality traits
- Key phrases you always use
- Message Guidelines

## Refine Your Visual Standards

You can add more details under the **Visual and Layout Standards** section, such as:

- Preferred photography styles
- Lighting and overall tone
- Layout structure and composition
- Exactly how your brand should look and feel
- Framing and cropping preferences

These cues help Bacon understand your brand's creative character.
