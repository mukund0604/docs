# Methods of Generation : How to Generate (URL & Upload Methods)

Bacon gives you two ultra-fast ways to generate images and videos:

1. Drop your product URL
2. Upload your product images manually

Both methods produce studio-quality creatives that match your brand identity automatically.

## METHOD 1: Generate Using a URL (Recommended Method ⭐)

### Step 1: Choose Your Mode

Once the system loads your brand profile, select:

**Image Ads / Video Ads / Influencer Ads / Veo3 Video** → Start Prompting!

### Step 2: Paste Your Product Link

Copy your website or product page URL and paste it into Bacon's input box.

Bacon instantly scans and finds your Brand DNA details, as discussed previously.

### Step 3: Refine Your Style, By Prompting

You can refine the direction by giving the system different prompts, by suggesting the type of ad you need or layouts you'd like, such as:

- Clean e-commerce
- Lifestyle scenes
- Gradient backgrounds
- Premium studio shots
- Bold DTC ads
- Seasonal concepts, etc.

Or skip this — Bacon will choose for you.

### Step 4: Generate Your Ads

Hit Generate.

In 10–20 seconds, you'll see:

- An on-brand image/video/influencer ad
- With copy, CTAs, typography, and brand elements already matched
- Auto-resized versions for Meta, TikTok, Google, YouTube, etc. based on your choosing

### Step 5: Customize (Optional)

Click any ad to edit:

- Swap background
- Change text, change text colour, font, etc.
- Add new product angles
- Reposition elements
- Modify layout
- Insert props, etc.

The creative is your playground, you can edit any element generated as you'd like!

### Step 6: Export Your Ad

Choose export options:

- PNG
- JPG

Your creatives are now launch-ready!

## METHOD 2: Generate Ads Using Product Uploads

If you don't have a URL, or want to use photos not on your website, use the Upload workflow.

### Step 1: Upload Your Product Images

By clicking on the attach icon, upload images of:

- Product photos
- Lifestyle photos
- Studio shots
- Raw phone images

Bacon removes backgrounds instantly and identifies:

- Product shape
- Material
- Texture
- Branding elements

### Step 3: Type a Prompt

Examples:

- "Make a clean e-commerce ad with modern gradients."
- "Lifestyle kitchen setting for a high-end cookware brand."

You can be as simple or detailed as you want!

### Step 4: Generate, Review and Edit as usual

You get: A Clean and professional ad, and you can choose to create multiple variations. The same full editor applies!
