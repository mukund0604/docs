# Welcome to Bacon: How It Works

## What is Bacon?

Bacon is your end-to-end, agentic AI creative engine - built to generate high-quality images, videos, UGC-style content, ads, posts, and branded assets, in minutes!

Instead of juggling designers, editors, templates, and tools, Bacon combines everything into one intelligent system that learns your brand and creates visuals automatically.

## What Bacon Helps You Do

- Turn product links into fully designed visuals
- Generate image ads, video ads, UGC content, posts, and cinematic visuals
- Clone high-performing ad styles from any brand
- Auto-write scripts, copy, storyboards & voiceovers
- Personalize everything to your brand colors, tone, and product style
- Produce pitch-ready, brand-ready assets in minutes

## How It Works

### 1. Add Your Website

You begin by entering your brand URL. Bacon scans your entire site: visuals, product pages, tone of voice, layout structure, colors, and key messaging. This scan becomes the foundation of your brand understanding inside the system.

### 2. Bacon Learns Your Brand

Once the scan completes, Bacon builds your Brand Profile: a dynamic identity layer that maps your logo, colors, product catalog, keywords, and tone. Every creative you generate pulls from this profile, so your output stays consistent without extra setup.

### 3. Choose What You Want to Create

From the dashboard, you pick the format you need - image ads, video ads, Veo 3 cinematic videos or UGC videos. You can upload a product shot, paste a link, or start with a blank concept.

You also choose your platform (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Google, etc.) and the aspect ratio you want the design to be tailored for.

### 4. Pick Your Generation Style

Before generating, you choose the level of control and quality you want:

- **Basic Model**: Faster output, perfect for exploration and high-volume variations.
- **Advanced Model**: Slower but produces more refined, high-quality visuals.

The models will have variations in credits utilised, which is elaborated in Billing and Credit Utilization guide.

You also decide between:

- **Autopilot Mode**: Bacon makes every creative decision itself - layout, background, tone, pacing, storytelling, color choices.
- **Pro Mode**: You guide the system step-by-step, giving detailed instructions at each stage.

### 5. Bacon Generates Your Creatives Instantly

Once you confirm your settings, Bacon builds the entire asset - visuals, layout, copy, script, transitions, and multiple variations! All matched to your brand profile and the platform you selected.

### 6. Refine, Download, or Save to Projects

Every output is editable. You can change backgrounds, swap scenes, retouch images, rewrite copy, regenerate layouts, or request variations.

When you're done, download the file or store it inside Projects to keep your creative sets organized by campaign.
