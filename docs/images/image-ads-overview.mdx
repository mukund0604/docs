# Image Ads Overview: Everything You Can Create With Bacon

Bacon gives you a complete visual production studio - without photographers, designers, or expensive software! With a single URL or product upload, you can generate high-performing image ads, branded concepts, product visuals, and platform-ready creative variations in seconds.

Here's a full overview of what's possible.

## What You Can Generate

Each variation is automatically optimized for Meta, Google, TikTok, and Instagram placements - based on the preferences you choose while prompting Bacon.
