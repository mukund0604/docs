# Autopilot vs Pro Mode

Bacon gives you two distinct ways to create ads - Autopilot Mode and Pro Mode. Both generate high-quality creatives, but each is designed for a different type of workflow and creator preference.

## Autopilot Mode (Agentic Creation)

**Best for:**

Creators who want the fastest, smartest, "do-it-for-me" experience.

**What it does:**

Autopilot Mode uses Bacon's AI Agent to make every creative decision for you. You provide one prompt, and the agent handles the rest - from strategy to design to platform-ready delivery.

**Autopilot automatically decides:**

- Layout and structure
- Style, tone, and theme
- Ideal target audience persona
- Color palette and visual identity
- Captions, copy, Scripts and call-to-action
- Transitions, pacing, and effects (for videos)

**What this means:**

You get the strongest possible ad output with zero manual effort. Just type what you want → hit Generate → get polished ads instantly

## Pro Mode (Manual Creative Control)

**Best for:**

Creators who want to steer the visual direction.

**What it does:**

Pro Mode unlocks full customization. Instead of the agent making decisions, you choose every major creative element.

**Pro Mode allows you to customize:**

- Overall theme (minimal, bold, luxury, organic, futuristic, etc.)
- Visual style
- Color treatment
- Layout and hierarchy
- Pacing (for videos)
- Manually select ICP segment
- Text placement
- Creative tone

In Pro Mode, you can also review and override the AI's suggestions which is great for brands with strict guidelines, agencies, and designers.
