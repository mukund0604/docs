# Video Ads Overview: 

Bacon's video generator is built for fast, scroll-stopping short-form ads that work across TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube Shorts, Snapchat, and more. Whether you upload your own product images or simply paste a URL, Bacon transforms your input into a polished, platform-ready video ad in seconds.

## What You Can Create

With Video Ads, Bacon automatically turns your product, website link, or uploaded image into a short promotional video (usually around 10 seconds). The system chooses transitions, pacing, layouts, captions, and visual flow for you, or you can customize them manually.

Videos are available in all common aspect ratios - from vertical 9:16 to widescreen 16:9 -so you can export once and post everywhere.

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Start with the main prompt bar

Type a simple request such as "Create a 10-second video ad for this product" and include your URL or description.

### 2. (Optional) Add Images

If you want to upload your own visuals, you can import assets from your device or choose existing files from your library.

### 3. Choose Your Aspect Ratio

Bacon lets you pick any of these formats: 2:3, 9:16, 3:4, 1:1, 3:2, 16:9, or 4:3.

This ensures the video fits perfectly on platforms like TikTok, Reels, YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, and more.

### 4. Select Basic or High Mode

**Basic Mode**\
The fastest and most affordable option. Ideal for quick ad creation with **medium-quality output**, perfect for testing ideas or rapid campaigns.

**High Mode**\
Delivers **high-quality videos** with enhanced visuals and effects. Generation takes a bit longer, but the results are more polished and premium.

Once everything is set, click Enter and Bacon starts creating high-quality video ads for you.

### 5. Choose Your Target Audience

Based on your prompt and content, Bacon analyzes your ad and suggests 3 - 4 target audience categories.
Select the audience that best fits your goal to reach the right people with wider and more effective reach.

Once selected, Bacon generates a polished video ad within minutes.
