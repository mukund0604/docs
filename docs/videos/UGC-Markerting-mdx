### What Is UGC in Bacon?

UGC (User-Generated Content) videos are designed to feel:

- Natural and unscripted
- Shot in real-life scenes
- Spoken in a relatable, human tone
- Native to social platforms (not “ad-looking” ads)

With Bacon, you simply **prompt for a UGC ad**, attach your product link, and the system does the rest.

## What You Can Create

With Video Ads, Bacon automatically turns your product, website link, or uploaded image into a short promotional video (usually around 10 seconds). The system chooses transitions, pacing, layouts, captions, and visual flow for you, or you can customize them manually.

Videos are available in all common aspect ratios - from vertical 9:16 to widescreen 16:9 -so you can export once and post everywhere.

## How UGC Video Ads Work (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Prompt for a UGC Ad

Start from the main prompt bar and type something like:

> “Create a UGC ad for my product”
>
> Paste your product or website link.

That’s it. Bacon understands you want **authentic, human-style content**, not a polished commercial.

### 2. Select Your Target Audience

Bacon will ask who the video is for.\
Examples:

- Skincare for women aged 18–25
- Fitness beginners
- Busy professionals
- College students

### 3. Choose Your Aspect Ratio

UGC videos are optimized for social feeds. Available UGC formats:

- **9:16** – TikTok, Reels, Shorts (recommended)
- **16:9** – YouTube, Facebook

Choose based on where you plan to post.

### 4. Verify Your Assets (Important)

Before generation, Bacon lets you review all assets used in the UGC video.

**Product Images**

- Automatically pulled from your URL
- Want to change them?
  - Click **Replace Image**
  - Upload from your device or swap with a better product photo

**Brand Logo**

- Review your brand logo
- If incorrect or missing:
  - Upload from your device
  - Or paste the exact image URL

Once verified, submit your assets.

### 5. Choose the UGC Video Category

This defines the _story_ of the video. Choose one:

1. **Testimonial** – Feels like a real user sharing their experience
2. **Review** – Honest product feedback and reactions
3. **Feature Explanation** – Casual breakdown of product benefits

This step matters more than people think. Pick the wrong category and the video will feel off.

### 6. Generate Your UGC Video

Click **Generate**.

Bacon creates a **ready-to-post UGC marketing video** in minutes:

- Realistic human flow
- Platform-native style
- Scroll-stopping opening
- Fully editable after generation

You can tweak text, visuals, or layouts anytime.

## Example UGC Prompts

Use these directly:

- “Create a UGC ad for this skincare product: https://yourproduct.com”
- “Make a UGC testimonial video for my fitness app”
- “Create a UGC review video for this product using a casual human tone”
- “Generate a UGC video ad for TikTok using this URL”

**_If your ad looks like an ad, users scroll.If it looks like real content, users watch._**

Bacon’s UGC videos are built to **blend into feeds**, not interrupt them - and that’s why they work.
