# Influencer Videos

Bacon's Influencer Videos let you create realistic talking-head style content with AI avatars and AI voices, perfect for 

testimonials, reviews, product explainers, and scripted ads that feel like they're delivered by real creators!

## What Influencer Videos Create

With Bacon, you control:

- The avatar
- The voice (accent, style, tone)
- The product placement
- The captions
- The script

Whether you want a soft-spoken wellness creator, a confident tech reviewer, or a hyper-energetic fitness coach — Bacon builds the perfect influencer for your brand!

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Start With a Prompt

Enter a prompt in the main bar like:

- "Create an influencer-style review for my skincare serum."
- "Make an avatar explain the benefits of my protein shake."

Then add your product link OR select a product from your Bacon Product Catalog.

Once you submit the prompt:

### 2. ICP Detection

Choose your **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)** so Bacon can create a video ad that speaks directly to the right audience.

### 3. Choose & Customize Your Avatar

You’ll now see **industry-based avatar categories**, designed to match your product and audience, such as:

- **Footwear**
- **Clothing**
- **Cosmetics**
- …and more

#### Customize Your Avatar

- **Select the gender** that best fits your brand voice
- **Choose the voice** that feels most natural and relatable for your audience

Once you’re happy with your selection, click **Confirm Selection** to continue.

### 4. Product Placement (Auto vs Manual)

Next, you'll choose how the product appears inside the influencer video.

Two modes:

- **Auto Mode**: The model positions the product automatically for optimal presentation.
- **Pro Mode**: You manually adjust product placement - size, position, and orientation.

Switch between Auto and Manual tabs anytime.

Once satisfied, click Save Placement.

### 5. Caption & Text Design

Now choose how your video displays captions:

- Font style
- Color
- Layout
- Text animation behavior

### 6. Script Selection & Editing

Bacon automatically generates a **UGC-style script** based on your prompt and selected ICP (Ideal Customer Profile).

You have full control at this stage:

1. **Use the script as-is**\
   If the message already feels natural and on-brand, you can move forward instantly.
2. **Rewrite or edit the script manually**\
   Modify the wording, tone, or structure directly in the editor to better match your brand voice or campaign goal.

click **Continue** to proceed.

### 7. Click Generate

Bacon now creates your influencer video using:

- Your chosen avatar
- Your selected voice
- Your product placement
- Your caption style
- Your approved script

## Why Influencer Videos Work

Influencer-style ads outperform traditional creative on social platforms because:

- they feel trustworthy, and personal
- audiences believe people, not brands!
- they blend right in with your organic content

## Example Prompts

- "Create an influencer-style product review for my sunscreen."
- "Generate a talking-head testimonial explaining why my water bottle is leakproof."
- "Make an avatar speak this script about my new app launch."
- "Create a 9:16 influencer video showing the benefits of my protein shake."
