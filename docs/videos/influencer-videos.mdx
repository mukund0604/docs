# Influencer Videos

Bacon's Influencer Videos let you create realistic talking-head style content with AI avatars and AI voices, perfect for testimonials, reviews, product explainers, and scripted ads that feel like they're delivered by real creators!

## What Influencer Videos Create

With Bacon, you control:

- The avatar
- The voice (accent, style, tone)
- The product placement
- The captions
- The script

Whether you want a soft-spoken wellness creator, a confident tech reviewer, or a hyper-energetic fitness coach — Bacon builds the perfect influencer for your brand!

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Start With a Prompt

Enter a prompt in the main bar like:

- "Create an influencer-style review for my skincare serum."
- "Make an avatar explain the benefits of my protein shake."

Then add your product link OR select a product from your Bacon Product Catalog.

Once you submit the prompt:

### 2. ICP Detection

Bacon automatically identifies your Ideal Customer Profiles based on the product.

- **In Pro Mode**: You choose which ICP you want the influencer to represent.
- **In Autopilot Mode**: Bacon selects the best-performing ICP automatically.

Click Next after selecting (or confirming) the ICP.

### 3. Choose & Customize Your Avatar

You'll now see industry-based avatar categories such as:

- Footwear
- Clothing
- Cosmetics
- Medicine
- Maternity
- Supplements
- Wigs
- Large Appliances
- Personal Care

…and more.

Then customize:

- Gender
- Age range
- Country/accent (for voice delivery)
- Speaking style (friendly, confident, calm, energetic, conversational, etc.)

Click Confirm Selection when done.

### 4. Product Placement (Auto vs Manual)

Next, you'll choose how the product appears inside the influencer video.

Two modes:

- **Autopilot Mode**: The model positions the product automatically for optimal presentation.
- **Pro Mode**: You manually adjust product placement - size, position, and orientation.

Switch between Auto and Manual tabs anytime.

Once satisfied, click Save Placement.

### 5. Caption & Text Design

Now choose how your video displays captions:

- Font style
- Color
- Layout
- Text animation behavior

### 6. Script Selection & Editing

Bacon generates a script based on your prompt and ICP.

You can:

- Use the script as-is
- Click "See More" to view 3–4 alternative versions
- Edit the script directly in the prompt bar
- Rewrite the entire script manually

Once the script feels right, continue.

### 7. Click Generate

Bacon now creates your influencer video using:

- Your chosen avatar
- Your selected voice
- Your product placement
- Your caption style
- Your approved script

## Why Influencer Videos Work

Influencer-style ads outperform traditional creative on social platforms because:

- they feel trustworthy, and personal
- audiences believe people, not brands!
- they blend right in with your organic content

## Example Prompts

- "Create an influencer-style product review for my sunscreen."
- "Generate a talking-head testimonial explaining why my water bottle is leakproof."
- "Make an avatar speak this script about my new app launch."
- "Create a 9:16 influencer video showing the benefits of my protein shake."
