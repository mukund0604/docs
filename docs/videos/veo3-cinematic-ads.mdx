# Veo3 Cinematic Ads: How They Work

Bacon's Veo3 generator is a next-gen video model that creates cinematic, high-fidelity, storytelling-driven ads - with or without start/end frames.

You can upload reference visuals if you want control…

…but if you don't?

Veo3 will still generate an entire, polished cinematic sequence from just your prompt!

Think:

- A soda can dancing on a rooftop
- A perfume bottle floating in outer space
- A shoe sprinting through a neon city
- A drone shot of your product like it's the next iPhone

It can do serious luxury or unhinged chaos. Have fun creating!

## What Veo3 Creates

Veo3 outputs premium cinematic ads with:

- Dramatic camera moves
- Scene-to-scene transitions
- Natural lighting + depth
- Rich textures and motion
- Full control (give the model detailed instructions) or full imagination (let the model do the work for you)

It supports both Veo3.1 HQ (High Quality) and Veo3.1 Fast models, giving you a balance between quality and speed depending on your campaign needs.

Videos can be output in vertical 9:16 or horizontal 16:9 aspect ratios, making them ideal for YouTube, Instagram Reels, TikTok, Meta, and display ads.

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Open the Veo3 Videos Workspace

Click on Veo3 Videos on the main page.

### 2. (Optional) Upload Reference Frames

You can add:

- **Start Frame** → sets the opening look
- **End Frame** → sets the final shot
- **Reference Images** → guide style, tone, or product design

These are NOT required. If you skip them, Veo3 invents visuals based on your prompt!

### 3. Add Creative Instructions

This part can be:

- **Professional**: "Luxury skincare ad with slow dolly-in and soft atmosphere."
- **Hyper-specific**: "Dark neon cyberpunk gym with reflections on the floor."
- **Or absolutely feral**: "A Pepsi can moonwalking across Times Square, filmed like a Nike commercial."

Veo3 understands tone, setting, vibes, action, pacing, lighting, and cinematography. The more context the prompt has, the better the model understands, the better the result!

### 4. Choose Your Model

- **Veo3.1 HQ** → Best quality, slightly slower render
- **Veo3.1 Fast** → Faster, suitable for quick iterations

### 5. Pick the Aspect Ratio

Choose between:

- 9:16 (vertical) for TikTok, Reels, Shorts
- 16:9 (horizontal) for YouTube, widescreen, or websites

### 6. Click Generate

Bacon stitches your frames, motion, visual flow, and instructions into a cinematic, polished ad!

## Why Veo3 Is Different

Unlike normal short-form ads that use preset transitions, Veo3:

- builds natural camera motion between two visual anchors
- adds cinematic lighting, depth, and motion
- generates full storytelling sequences

This makes it suitable for industries like jewelry, fashion, electronics, fitness equipment, wellness, luxury skincare, real estate, and more.

## Best Practices

To get strong results:

- Use high-quality start and end frames (even AI-generated ones work great).
- Add specific instructions like "soft gold lighting" or "dramatic neon atmosphere."
- Keep prompts simple but descriptive; Veo handles the interpretation.
- Try both Fast and HQ models to compare quality.

## Example Prompts

You can use any of these as-is:

- "Cinematic ad highlighting premium jewelry. Soft gold lighting, elegant slow zoom."
- "Create a dramatic 9:16 promo for my tech gadget launch with neon edges."
- "Make a cinematic fashion ad with smooth camera transitions and soft color grading."
- "Create a 16:9 video with a dynamic reveal and luxury-style lighting."
