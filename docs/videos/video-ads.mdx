# Video Ads Overview: Auto-Cut, Scripts, Voiceovers & Styles

Bacon's video generator is built for fast, scroll-stopping short-form ads that work across TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube Shorts, Snapchat, and more. Whether you upload your own product images or simply paste a URL, Bacon transforms your input into a polished, platform-ready video ad in seconds.

## What You Can Create

With Video Ads, Bacon automatically turns your product, website link, or uploaded image into a short promotional video (usually around 10 seconds). The system chooses transitions, pacing, layouts, captions, and visual flow for you, or you can customize them manually.

Videos are available in all common aspect ratios — from vertical 9:16 to widescreen 16:9 — so you can export once and post everywhere.

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Start with the main prompt bar

Type a simple request such as "Create a 10-second video ad for this product" and include your URL or description.

### 2. (Optional) Add Images

If you want to upload your own visuals, you can import assets from your device or choose existing files from your library.

### 3. Choose Your Aspect Ratio

Bacon lets you pick any of these formats: 2:3, 9:16, 3:4, 1:1, 3:2, 16:9, or 4:3.

This ensures the video fits perfectly on platforms like TikTok, Reels, YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, and more.

### 4. Select Autopilot or Pro Mode

- In **Autopilot**, the AI chooses the best visual style, transitions, pacing, text, and CTA based on your product.
- In **Pro Mode**, you can refine the video by choosing themes, color styles, layout direction, audience segment to be targeted, and effects.

### 5. Click Generate

Bacon converts your product image into a full blown video ad, based on your prompt and settings. Every version is fully editable, so you can adjust text, layouts, and visuals even after generation.

## Autopilot (AI-Handled Mode)

Autopilot is ideal when you want a ready-to-launch video instantly. The AI determines:

- creative style and layout
- color palette
- Audience segment to target
- pacing and transitions
- best CTA and copy
- platform-optimized format

This mode is perfect for quick campaign launches, last-minute ads, or creators who prefer a hands-off workflow.

## Pro Mode (Manual Creative Control)

Pro Mode is for users who want deeper creative control. This mode allows you to select:

- overall theme
- tone and visual style
- layout flow
- transition pacing
- design effects

## Example Prompts

Here are some prompts you can use directly:

- "Create an Instagram video for this product: https://yourproduct.com"
- "Make a TikTok ad showing a 30% festival discount for my skincare brand."
- "Turn these images into a 10-second video ad for a shoe launch."
- "Create a Facebook video using this URL: https://yourproduct.com/bag"
