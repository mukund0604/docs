# Workspace Overview: Navigating the Bacon Dashboard

Bacon's workspace is designed to give you a fast, intuitive, and streamlined creative workflow. Here's a complete breakdown of what each section does:

## Home Page (Main Dashboard)

This is the central hub where all creation begins.

What you can do here:

- Enter prompts to generate creatives
- Paste your product URL to auto-generate assets
- Upload images for edits, variations, or video generation
- Choose between Images, Video Ads, Veo3 Cinematic Ads, UGC, and Influencer formats
- Switch between Autopilot and Pro Mode
- View quick shortcuts to your recent projects

## Library Page

This is where every asset generated by Bacon lives - neatly organized and always easy to find.

What you can do here:

- Browse all your generated images, videos, and UGC ads
- Upload external assets (old creatives, product photos, brand visuals) to store them in one unified place
- Use the Filter tool to sort assets by type (Image / Video), date, project, or format
- Open any asset to download, duplicate, regenerate, or create variants
- Maintain a clean creative library that scales as you do

## Brand DNA Page

This is your brand's identity vault — the foundation of Bacon's Brand Intelligence system.

What it contains:

- Your brand colors
- Fonts
- Logos
- Key Phrases
- Brand tone & personality notes
- Visual Layout style details
- Audience notes & value props

This page is covered in full detail in the Brand Setup & Brand Intelligence guide.
